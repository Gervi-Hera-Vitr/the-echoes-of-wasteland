The most fundamental part of the [_Hacker Collective_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_culture "What Wiki knows about us...") is sharing!
And most valuable of all to share is knowledge. Much like other cliques, we're all about sharing knowledge.

## Gervi Héra Vitr

[![Gervi Héra Vitr Logo](../rezs/images/slug-gervi-avatar.png "Gervi Héra Vitr Logo")](https://github.com/Gervi-Hera-Vitr "GitHub Gervi Héra Vitr") Our own [_**energetic community**_](https://github.com/Gervi-Hera-Vitr) of Munchkin game developers and artists.

Munchkins here experiment with AI, game design, story development, and are organized by [_Learning Trails_](https://github.com/orgs/Gervi-Hera-Vitr/projects/1 "Learning Trails Project") adult hackers help with.

## AGAIN

[![Again Logo](../rezs/images/slug-again-avatar.png "Again Logo")](https://github.com/Gotham-Village/ "GitHub Again") A compassion and empathy driven [community of founders](https://github.com/Gotham-Village/ "Gotham Village"), coders, artists.

The _GitHub AGAIN_ community started as a Discord group of friends and family named _AlGothAmalgaNotions_ and eventually created a shared GitHub space for its members to share knowledge, code, and collaborate on projects.
The community is a long-term effort.

### Core Values

Mímis` is the **_governance guild_**. 
Thus is addition to all the _production artifacts_ ranging from implementations to curricula,
the Gildí maintain the community **_Core Values_** and publish policy.

## Mímis Scala

[![Mimis Scala](../rezs/images/slug-scala-avatar.png "Mimis Scala Logo")](https://github.com/Mimis-Scala "GitHub Mimis Scala") This is a legacy guild yet few successful mSaaS [**_Scala_**](https://www.scala-lang.org/ "The Scala Programming Language") artifacts are in production.

## Mímis Látlæg Háttalag

[![Látlæg Háttalag](../rezs/images/slug-latlag-avatar.png "Látlæg Háttalag Logo")](https://github.com/Mimis-Latlaeg-Hattalag) Last but not least guild and community dedicated to Corporate America.

Látlæg Háttalag is in fact the oldest functioning community of Mímis Gildí.
Its long and turbulent history has taken its members on an exciting journey.
Founded by a female PennState professor guild members called Ada and her team of researchers,
soon spanning many schools.
Collectively the teachers introduced eager young minds to many wonders of the analytical world,
not just in mathematics, physics, and computer science, but also in the arts, humanities and horticulture.

### 1990s MeetSuite

The guild took on its own identity as a chapter of the Northern in philadelphia.
Over time Northern became very corporate and political.
Most young hackers having graduated various levels of college entered workforce, 
and soon were disillusioned by the lack of appreciation for intellect in the mundane corporate America.
In 1997 guild members dispersed in many directions. 
Some moved to Amsterdam in search of new freedoms.
Others traveled the world in search of enlightenment.
Few have joined the military and federal security services and spookeries.

### 2000s WileEeeMissalee

Through the dawn of the millennia, 
most of the guild members congregated around a few DoD startups,
such as MassivelyParallel and ISS Inc., making fun of the government bureaucracy.

### 2010s TurboLaggards

Most of the community members embraced early retirement and left the guild.
People still dabbled in programming and experimented with startups.
But now mainly exploiting the general corporate-cog ignorance and herd mentality for easy income:
buzzword-hungry laggards buying vaporware.

### 2017 Látlæg Háttalag - Resurrection

Most of MeetSuite guildies haven't been blessed with children.
Some consciously elected to have no kids dedicating themselves to work.
Few, however, have taken a very different path: family-oriented.
Always a minority in the guild of the past the few focused more on mentoring than LOLs.
Today, these hackers are the members of Mímis Gildí also preserving the Látlæg Háttalag chapter.
