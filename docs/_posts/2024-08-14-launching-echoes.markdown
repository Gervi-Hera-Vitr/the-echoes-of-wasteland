I'm delighted to be invited by a pair of capable Munchkins and help them on their exciting learning journey.

For posterity, here are the rules offered on my behavior and contributions: ðŸ˜‰

- Never interfere with the flow of the Scene (ROFL ðŸ¤ª);
- Never suggest anything twice;
- Be nice and friendly 'coach' not a player.

I'm delighted and honored to be accepted by these young hackers.
Clearly, their personal leadership is already well in tow, 
and I'll be happy to help them out in any way I am invited to.
