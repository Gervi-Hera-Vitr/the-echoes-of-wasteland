On this fine Tuesday, my best friend and I asked my father, [rdd13r](https://github.com/rdd13r "R!dd13r"),
to help us
organize ourselves for the upcoming Echoes of the Wasteland mod
library [community event](https://github.com/Gotham-Village "Gotham Village").
We're excited to see what this old hacker would suggest to us.
First thing he's recommended to involving my friend's father as well.
Both of our fathers are independent hackers and founders running SaaS teams.

And, so far, the suggestions are rather cliché, and here we go with the following:

- Make this repo public;
- Setup CI/CD;
- Create a [Jekyll site](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/github-pages/ "Jekyll");
- And, start a community discussion.

So, here we go...
